<p> All the videos' password is 3939 to view them. The second video is the project about a non-narrative film, my film was going through the process of drawing and creating my own character. His name is Leonidus, the guardian of the undead. The name Leonidus came from how it's like a lion's name. The name gives a loyal, intimidating, and strong vibe like how a lion's nature is like. </p>
