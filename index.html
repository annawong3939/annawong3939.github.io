    <p> The second video is the project about a non-narrative film, my film was going through the process of drawing and creating my own character. His name is Leonidus, the guardian of the undead. The name Leonidus came from how it's like a lion's name. The name gives a loyal, intimidating, and strong vibe like how a lion's nature is like. I hope and dream that he will one day be in a video game character, which is what I'm aiming for; working into a gaming industry as I work hard getting into the Digital Media Arts program. </p>
