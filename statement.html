    <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
      <p>Art is <em>the best. <p>I enjoy creating my own character designs and drawing ideas for them, inspired me to make amazing art! </em> When someone asks me why I make art, I ask them: <strong>I LIKE TO CREATE. </em> I want people to enjoy and admire the creations I share to the world by my creations becoming a part of their life. Much like how I was inspired by popular video games concept and design.
